# Quintessential Curations

This App will search artists or bands similar to a band that the user enjoy. The user can search for a band of their choice and a list will be displayed of simiar artists with a short biography of each and 25 of their most popular songs. The user will also be able to play the songs from the list that is generated.

## To run the App

Using the search box, the user can search for their favorite artist or band. Once the list is generated eight cards will be displayed on the page which include the artists name, genre, album cover and a song to play. For more information about the artist and additional songs by them, the user can click on each card and a modal will pop up displaying a list of additional songs by the artist as well as a brief bio.
